- **Description**:
  - This is a Library Management System that utilizes a Book class and JSON files to manage book records with unique ISBNs.

- **Underlying Logic**:
  - The system employs a specialized "Book" class consistently, stores data in JSON format, and ensures each book is identified by a unique ISBN.
  - The system employs a "foreach" loop to search for and manipulate books.
  - It utilizes an "if-else" ladder to check the availability of each book.
  - A "switch" statement is used to determine and set the genre of each book.
