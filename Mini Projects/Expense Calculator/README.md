- **Description**:
  - This is a simple Expense Tracker application that allows users to record expenses and view them in a tabular format.

- **Underlying Logic**:
  - The application uses a CSV file as a simple database to store expenses.
  - File I/O operations are used to perform expense-related operations (addition and viewing).
  - Client-side validation is applied to check the inputs for valid entries.
  - User inputs (expense name and amount) are written into the CSV file.
  - The CSV file is then read and displayed to show the recorded expenses.
