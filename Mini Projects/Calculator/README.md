- **Description**:
  - This is a simple Calculator application that allows users to perform arithmetic operations.

- **Underlying Logic**:
  - The application uses PHP's `switch` statements to determine the selected operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
  - Input validation checks if the provided numbers are numeric.
  - Depending on the selected operation, the calculator performs the corresponding mathematical calculation.
  - Error messages are displayed for non-numeric inputs and division by zero.
